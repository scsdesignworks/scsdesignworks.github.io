COLORs. It’s a simple word that we have been using for centuries. Colors carry great depth, much love, vibrancy, and happiness, are symbolic and even have a tendency to heal. TAKIYA KALAM emerged from Sukhmani Cheema Sandhu’s fascination with colors and their playful nature to bring all things to life.

Sukhmani completed her professional schooling in Textile design in Berkeley, California. Her expertise in textiles, is showcased through her designs and creativity. She has travelled extensively and understands and appreciates different cultures. Thus you will find that her creations have a very strong imprint of motifs and prints from around the world.

“I have a passion for matching different fabrics with contemporary and traditional genres. This technique brings a customized look to address ones preferences for textiles. I love to interact with my customers to understand their persona and then create a design according to their liking.”

A flawless design once created, is given the reverence of being fashioned only one time, making a unique collection.
